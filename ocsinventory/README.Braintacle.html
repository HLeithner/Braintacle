<h1>Braintacle's patched version of OCS Inventory NG</h1>

<h2>About this version</h2>

<p>
This is a patched version of <a href="http://ocsinventory-ng.org">OCS inventory NG</a>
2.0.4/1.3.3 that uses a database abstraction layer for all database access,
allowing to work with databases other than MySQL.
It was developed and tested with PostgreSQL, which is the recommended database for this version.
MySQL is also supported.
Other databases might work, but are entirely untested.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
This project is not provided by the OCSInventory team.
Do not bother them with any issues you encounter with this version.
Use Braintacle's support tracker or mailing list instead.
</strong>
</p>
<p>
This version comes bundled with <a href="http://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/braintacle/">Braintacle</a>.
It is not a requirement for using Braintacle if you use MySQL &ndash; Braintacle works with the database of an unmodified Installation of OCS Inventory, too.
<p>
<strong>This version of the ocsreports console is deprecated.
It will be maintained for important bugfixes, but no longer receive any major upgrades.</strong>
Most notably, it will stick at version 1.3.3.
Version 2.x will not be ported.
New features will be implemented in the Braintacle console only.
</p>
<p>
The modified installer is currently available for UNIXoid OSes only.
The scripts themselves are OS-independent, so they could be installed manually on Windows too.
</p>
<p>
The agent that runs on the clients does not make any direct database connections.
All interaction runs through the communication server via HTTP/HTTPS.
No special version of the agent is required for the modified server.
Use any of the <a href="http://www.ocsinventory-ng.org/en/download/download-agent.html">
OCS Inventory NG agents</a>.
</p>

<h3>Differences to the original version</h3>

<p>
Besides the different database access methods, more changes have been made to the code:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Some
<a href="http://svn.savannah.nongnu.org/viewvc/*checkout*/trunk/schema/README.html?root=braintacle">
changes to the database schema</a> were necessary for portability.
Braintacle and its bundled OCS Inventory code work with both schema types (Braintacle and OCS),
but an unmodified OCS Inventory installation will not work with the Braintacle schema.
</li>
<li>
Most of the setup must be done manually, giving the administrator more control over the installation process.
This is better than having a script messing with the system, which might break things and makes uninstallation
more difficult.<br>
Detailed installation instructions are given in this document.
The setup script is deprecated and only used for stuff which has not yet been optimized and documented
for manual installation.
</li>
<li>
The workaround for <a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/ocsinventory-windows-agent/+bug/530881">bug #530881</a> is included.
</li>
<li>
The caching feature is disabled by default.
Leave it disabled.
</li>
<li>
A lot of improvements under the hood.
</li>
</ul>


<h2>Installation</h2>

<h3>Install Braintacle first</h3>

<p>
This version cannot be run standalone.
It depends on a properly configured Braintacle installation.
In particular, the database.ini file needs to be set up for the schema manager (see below).
Refer to Braintacle's main documentation for instructions.
</p>

<h3>Create the database and user</h3>

<p>
If you don't already have the database set up somewhere, you need to create it along with a database user.
Install a PostgreSQL (recommended) or MySQL server, if not already available, and log into that
database server with superuser privileges (typically the 'postgres' user for PostgreSQL, 'root' for MySQL).
</p>
<p>
For PostgreSQL, run:
</p>
<p>
<code>
CREATE USER ocs WITH PASSWORD 'ocs';<br>
CREATE DATABASE ocsweb OWNER ocs ENCODING 'UTF8';
</code>
</p>
<p>
For MySQL, run:
</p>
<p>
<code>
CREATE USER ocs IDENTIFIED BY 'ocs';<br>
CREATE DATABASE ocsweb CHARACTER SET utf8;<br>
GRANT ALL ON ocsweb.* TO ocs;
</code>
</p>
<p>
You can choose any username or password.
The database name 'ocsweb' is currently hardcoded in some parts of the OCS Inventory code
and should not be changed.
UTF8 encoding is strongly recommended.
</p>
<p>
To create and initialize the tables, log out from the database and run the schema manager script
in the <em>tools</em> directory:
</p>
<p>
<code>
php tools/schema-manager.php --force
</code>
</p>
<p>
This will also create a default account 'admin' with the password 'admin'.
This should be changed immediately.
Point your browser to the URL of your braintacle installation, log in and click 'Preferences', then 'Users'.
Click on 'Edit', enter a new password, and optionally a different user name.
</p>

<h3>Install the communication server</h3>

<h4>Requirements</h4>

<p>
The communication server requires an Apache installation.
Other web servers are not supported because it heavily relies on mod_perl and its interface to Apache internals.
A Perl interpreter is installed by default most GNU/Linux distributions.
Some nonstandard perl modules are required.
There are several ways to install them, in preferred order:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
As a native package from a GNU/Linux distribution, see the table below
</li>
<li>
Via the <em>cpan</em> command line utility
</li>
<li>
Manual download from <a href="http://cpan.org">CPAN</a> (take care of dependencies for yourself)
</li>
</ol>
<table border="1">
<tr>
<th>Module</th><th>Debian/Ubuntu</th><th>Fedora</th><th>SUSE</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>mod_perl2</td><td>libapache2-mod-perl2</td><td>mod_perl</td><td>apache2-mod_perl</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Compress::Zlib</td><td>(already present)</td><td>perl-IO-Compress</td><td>?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>DBI</td><td>libdbi-perl</td><td>perl-DBI</td><td>perl-DBI</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>DBD::Pg (PostgreSQL only)</td><td>libdbd-pg-perl</td><td>perl-DBD-Pg</td><td>perl-DBD-Pg</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>DBD::mysql (MySQL only)</td><td>libdbd-mysql-perl</td><td>perl-DBD-MySQL</td><td>perl-DBD-mysql</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Apache::DBI</td><td>libapache-dbi-perl</td><td>perl-Apache-DBI</td><td>perl-Apache-DBI</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Date::Calc</td><td>libdate-calc-perl</td><td>perl-Date-Calc</td><td>perl-Date-Calc</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>XML::Simple</td><td>libxml-simple-perl</td><td>perl-XML-Simple</td><td>perl-XML-Simple</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>SOAP::Lite (optional)</td><td>libsoap-lite-perl</td><td>perl-SOAP-Lite</td><td>perl-SOAP-Lite</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>XML::Entities (optional)</td><td>(not available, use CPAN)</td><td>perl-XML-Entities</td><td>perl-XML-Entities</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>
If you have used an unmodified version of OCS Inventory before, most of these Modules will probably already be installed.
Beware of the additional dependency on Date::Calc!
</p>
<p>
The last 2 modules are only required for the SOAP service.
This is optional and entiely untested.
</p>

<h4>Prepare for trouble</h4>

<p>
mod_perl is unforgiving about compile time errors and will cause Apache to die on start/reload
if something important goes wrong, like missing Perl modules.
If your Apache installation hosts other applications, these will be unavailable until the problem is fixed.
Pick a good moment for installation, when unexpected downtime can be afforded.
</p>
<p>
If possible, consider a dedicated Apache installation exclusively for the communication server.
That would isolate any problems to that instance and not affect other web applications.
It is also possible to run multiple Apache instances with different configuration independently
on the same machine, as long as no 2 instances listen on the same combination of IP address and port.
Some systems like FreeBSD and recent versions of Debian and Ubuntu offer configuration tools to
support this out of the box.
With a bit of tweaking, this should be possible on other systems too.
</p>
<p>
Details about the error can be found in the Apache error log.
If you don't know how to fix the problem and need to resurrect Apache quickly, remove the configuration file
(ocsinventory-server.conf) from the Apache configuration directory,
typically /etc/apache2/conf.d/, and start Apache.
<p>

<h4>Installation</h4>

<p>
Copy the sample configuration file ocsinventory/etc/ocsinventory/ocsinventory-server.conf
to your apache configuration directory (typically /etc/apache2/conf.d), for example:
</p>
<p>
<code>
cp /usr/local/share/braintacle/ocsinventory/etc/ocsinventory/ocsinventory-server.conf /etc/apache2/conf.d/
</code>
</p>
<p>
Edit the copied file to match your environment.
In particular, adapt the first 2 sections ("General runtime environment settings" and "Master Database settings").
The default settings from the rest of the file will not need to be changed to make things work.
However, you may want to review the settings, in particular the access control directives at the
bottom of the file if you don't want unrestricted access on all virtual hosts.
</p>
<p>
It is important that mod_perl is loaded before that file is included.
This is the case in most standard Apache setups where modules are set up before conf.d gets evaluated.
If mod_perl is loaded from a config file in the same directory, make sure that its name comes before
ocsinventory-server.conf in alphabetical order.
Rename the file if necessary.
</p>
<p>
The log file is configured through the setup.sh script in the ocsinventory directory.
It assumes this directory to be the current working directory, so don't forget to change to that directory first:
<p>
<p>
<code>
cd ocsinventory<br>
sh setup.sh
</code>
</p>
<p>
Follow the instructions of the script.
If everything went without error, reload the Apache configuration (see warning above).
You may see some errors in the Apache log file like this:
</p>
<pre>
ocsinventory-server: Can't load SOAP::Transport::HTTP* - Web service will be unavailable
</pre>
<p>
These messages are harmless and can be ignored if you don't plan to use the SOAP service.
</p>

<h3>Installation of administration console (optional and deprecated)</h3>

<p>
The administration console (ocsreports) is not installed automatically.
It should not be used except for some operations not yet supported by the Braintacle console:
<ul>
<li>
Creating or deleting user defined fields.
Braintacle already supports displaying and editing their content
(under the "User defined" tab in a computer's inventory).
Only the definition needs to be done via ocsreports.
</li>
<li>
Creating groups.
Braintacle can display and delete groups and manage manual membership and assigned packages,
but not yet create new groups.
</li>
<li>
Overriding global configuration for specific computers or groups.
The global configuration can already be done in Braintacle.
</li>
<li>
Defining and querying inventoried registry keys.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Some other operations are intentionally not supported by Braintacle,
like multiple download servers or agent upload.
Do not use ocsreports for these operations &ndash; they are deprecated and untested.
</p>

<h4>Requirements</h4>

<p>
The database must already be set up with the schema manager.
</p>
<p>
You need the pgsql/mysql PHP extension.
It is avaliable as a package for GNU/Linux distributions:
<table border="1">
<tr>
<th>PHP extension</th><th>Debian/Ubuntu</th><th>Fedora</th><th>SUSE</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>pgsql</td><td>php5-pgsql</td><td>php-pgsql</td><td>php5-pgsql</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>mysql</td><td>php5-mysql</td><td>php-mysql</td><td>php5-mysql</td>
</tr>
</table>

<h4>Configuration</h4>

<ol>
<li>
Copy ocsinventory/etc/ocsinventory/ocsinventory-reports.conf to a place where Apache will read it.
Typically this is "/etc/apache2/conf.d".
</li>
<li>
The default configuration may not be appropriate for your particular Apache setup.
Read the comments in the configuration file and edit it to suit your needs.
</li>
<li>
Edit ocsinventory/ocsreports/dbconfig.inc.php to match your database setup.
The default configuration uses MySQL on localhost with a default username and password.
</li>
<li>
Since dbconfig.inc.php contains your database credentials, it should not be world readable.
It must of course be readable for your web server.
</li>
</ol>

<h2>Technical details</h2>

<p>The following information may be helpful if you try to hack the code yourself. If you just want to use it you can skip the rest of this document.</p>

<h3>Database Abstraction layers</h3>

<p>
The perl code uses the DBI class as an abstraction layer.
Making the driver configurable instead of hardcoding to "mysql" does most of the trick.
</p>
<p>
The PHP part is much trickier.
It uses native MySQL library functions which have to be changed one by one.
Since the MDB2 API is much different from the MySQL API, direct use would be a painful and error prone procedure.
So I wrote some wrapper functions <em>mdb2_foo()</em> to mimic the behaior of the corresponding <em>mysql_foo()</em> functions.
This way a simple search-and-replace operation brings us halfway to our goal.
See <em>ocsreports/require/function_mdb2.php</em> for supported functions and caveats.
</p>
<p>
There are some limitations:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Some functions are not strictly compatible with their mysql counterparts and require adjustments to the calling code. See the comments for details.</li>
<li><em>mdb2_query()</em> only supports SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE and DELETE operations. There were occasional uses of SHOW and ALTER TABLE, which are not portable. MDB2 provides abstraction for these operations. This required rewriting the code portion. The same operations replace <em>mysql_field_type()</em> and <em>mysql_fetch_field()</em>.</li>
<li>There is no <em>mdb2_fetch_array()</em> function. I could have implemented one, but using either <em>mdb2_fetch_assoc()</em> or <em>mdb2_fetch_row()</em> is cleaner and sufficient in most cases. There were a few cases where both associative and numeric indices werde needed. These are special cases where only the first entry is needed, so I wrote a workaround directly in the code.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Some functions have extra optional arguments for enhanced functionality.
For example, <em>mdb2_query()</em> supports prepared statements via 2 extra arguments.
Since these arguments are optional, it is still suitable as a drop-in replacement for <em>mysql_query()</em>.
</p>

<h3>SQL compatibility</h3>

<p>
Unfortunately, the API switch does only half of the job.
There were many MySQL-specific expressions present in the code.
This started with inconsistent quoting (MySQL allows single and double quotes for string literals, while standard SQL requires single quotes) and other obvious stuff like "LIMIT a,b" instead of standard "LIMIT b OFFSET a".
There were some less obvious issues like columns in GROUP BY clauses which are not present in the FROM clause (this is allowed by MySQL, but not standard SQL).
It even turned out that some of these grouping statements were completely unnecessary.
</p>
<p>
I converted the statements to all standard SQL, assuming this will be understood by all databases. MDB2's Function module helps increasing portability. Since the provided database backend can be queried at runtime, DBMS-specific extensions like PostgreSQLs ILIKE operator can be used without breaking compatibility with other DBMS.
</p>

<h3>Spelling of column identifiers</h3>

<p>
Another problem is case-sensitiveness of array/hash keys.
Whenever a database function returns an array (PHP) or hash (Perl) with column identifiers as keys, it's up to the API whether these are uppercase or lowercase.
PostgreSQL seems to return all lowercase identifiers, while MySQL seems to adapt the spelling from the query string (or table creation statement in case of <code>"SELECT * FROM...")</code>.
Unfortunately, <code>$foo['bar']</code> is not the same as <code>$foo['BAR']</code>.
The same applies to object members returned by <em>mdb2_fetch_object()</em>.
</p>
<p>
Since this behavior would make database applications effectively unportable, both DBI and MDB2 provide an option to convert identifiers to all uppercase or all lowercase.
It's then up to the application to use all uppercase or all lowercase throughout the code.
</p>
<p>
The perl code consistently uses uppercase spelling.
The only necessary step was turning on uppercase conversion globally.
</p>
<p>
The PHP code was not that friendly.
While the majority of the code uses lowercase spelling, there was a significant amount of uppercase use.
MDB2 converts the identifiers to lowercase.
Logging E_NOTICE messages helps spotting non-lowercase identifiers even for complex, dynamically generated queries.
Speaking of which...

<h3>Getting rid of E_NOTICE messages</h3>

<p>
Unfortunately, this code was developed with E_NOTICE logging turned off.
Turning it on initially resulted in tons of messages flooding the logfile, making it nearly impossible to find the real errors between all those mostly harmless ones.
Most of these result from situations like this:
</p>
<pre>
if ($_GET['foo'] == 'bar')...
</pre>
<p>
which drops an E_NOTICE if the parameter 'foo' is not present.
This is not an error &ndash; the code behaves just as expected.
I wrote a helper function called check_param() to handle this.
This workaround is quite clumsy and not a substitute for a more sophisticated parameter handling, but this would require a LOT more changes to the code, making it nearly impossible to merge future upstream changes.
</p>

<h3>Tracking down problems</h3>

<p>
If you observe erratic behavior, check your logfiles. The answer is probably out there. Many of the issues introduced by my patches result from code expecting uppercase indices (remember, they all get converted to lowercase). A less frequent class of bugs results from substituting <em>mysql_fetch_array()</em> and <em>MYSQL_FETCHMODE_BOTH</em> (the default) with either <em>mdb2_fetch_assoc()</em> (associative indices, sufficient in most cases) or <em>mdb2_fetch_row()</em> (numeric indices, not so often) in rare cases where both associative and numeric indices are actually needed. All these bugs are accompanied by an "undefined index" message. Thanks to the logged filename and line number, the source of the error is easily spotted and fixed.
</p>
<p>
Another problem with case-changed indices are case-sensitive string comparisions. These are harder to track down because they fail silently without an error message. Similarly, string comparisions at SQL level behave differently: in MySQL they are case insensitive while in PostgreSQL they are case sensitive.
