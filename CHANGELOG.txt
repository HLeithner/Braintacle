CHANGES IN VERSION 0.16
=======================

Fixed bugs:

- Console: Fixed errors and warnings with ZF 1.12.8.


CHANGES IN VERSION 0.15
=======================

Upgrading from previous versions:

- Required: Run tools/schema-manager.php to update the database schema.

- Recommended: Upgrade Zend Framework to 1.12.8 or later.

New features:

- Console: Partial support for extended download options (forced/scheduled
  download etc.) introduced by new server version. There is no user interface
  yet to set these options, but they are gracefully handled when updating/
  assigning/deleting packages.

Fixed bugs:

- Console: Fixed possible XSS.

- Console: Fixed exception when searching for an empty string with exact match.

- Console: When deleting a computer, unchecking the "Delete interfaces from
  network listing" checkbox had no effect.

- Console: Ultimate fix for the locking problem insufficiently addressed in the
  previous release.

Misc:

- Server: Updated server to version 2.1.2.

- General: Minimum ZF version is now 1.12.8.


CHANGES IN VERSION 0.14
=======================

Fixed bugs:

- Console: Fixed possible XSS.

- Console: Fixed fatal error when a locking conflict occurs.


CHANGES IN VERSION 0.13
=======================

Upgrading from previous versions:

- Recommended: Starting with this release, all major features are avalable in
  the Braintacle console. obsoleting the bundled ocsreports. If you have set up
  ocsreports, consider removing it from your web server configuration. It will
  be removed entirely in the next major release.

- Recommended: The Apache configuration for the console has been improved. The
  previous configuration should continue to work for most sites, but should be
  re-created from the new template (config/braintacle-console.conf.template)

New features:

- Console: Added individual configuration for computers and groups (via the
  "Configuration" button). Note that some options are not shown if they are
  disabled globally or in a group of which a computer is a member.

Fixed bugs:

- Console: Fixed exception when exporting computers with inventoried registry
  data.

- Console: Fixed incorrect display of duplicates if a group has the same name as
  a computer.

Misc:

- Server: The inventory cache is now permanently disabled. Configuration is
  ignored. It was disabled by default, but never worked with Braintacle if
  enabled. This feature is deprecated anyway and there are no plans to fix it.


CHANGES IN VERSION 0.12
=======================

New features:

- Console: Management of inventoried registry keys. In the "Registry" section of
  an inventoried Windows computer or in Preferences->Inventory, click the
  "Manage inventoried values" link.
  This form also enables turning registry inspection on/off, in addition to the
  "Inventory" preferences dialog.

- Console: The full registry value of inventoried registry data is shown as a
  tooltip over its name.

- Console: Inventoried registry values are shown in a separate column, separate
  from the data.

- Console: Added search for registry values/data. For every defined value there
  is 1 entry in the search dropdown. The search operates on both the value and
  the data for that value.

Fixed bugs:

- Console: Fixed error when displaying userdefined columns with names containing
  commas.

- Console: Fixed nonstandard (ZF-Style) URL parameter syntax in navigation and
  redirect URLs.

- Console: Fixed invalid markup for HTML elements without content.


CHANGES IN VERSION 0.11
=======================

Upgrading from previous versions:

- Required: Some external libraries (Zend Framework and NADA) are no longer
  included in the distribution. They must be installed manually. See INSTALL.md
  for more information.

- Recommended: If you added "AllowEncodedSlashes On" to your Apache
  configuration, as told in previuos installation instructions, remove it.
  Braintacle is no longer affected by this directive, which should be left at
  its default setting unless required by other applications.

New features:

- Console: Groups can now be created from search results. Queries can be set on
  groups, results can be added or excluded.

- Console: Group page shows excluded computers.

- Console: The Network page displays an additional table with all defined device
  types and the number of identified devices per type. A link below that table
  leads to a form that allows adding, renaming and deleting device types. Only
  types that are not assigned to any device can be deleted.

- Console: Subnet properties can be edited.

- Tools: New script update-from-git.sh for installations that run directly off
  a git tree. The script takes care of pulling the latest changes and updating
  the database if necessary.

Fixed bugs:

- Console: Fixed display of package creation dates (0.10 regression)

- Console: Display printers for non-Windows systems too. Note: the UNIX agent
  support for printers is rather limited.

- Console: No longer relies on Apache's AllowEncodedSlashes setting.

- Tools: Fixed various problems with the schema manager.

Misc:

- Console: Updated the database that determines the vendor from a MAC address.

- Console: Users can no longer lock themselves out by deleting their own
  account.

- Console: Translations are now read directly from the shipped .po-files, thus
  eliminating the need to compile them to .mo format first.

- Tools: The script update-translation.php is no longer needed by end users and
  has been moved to the development directory. The --noextract option is no
  longer supported as extracting strings is now the script's only purpose (no
  .mo compilation any more).

- General: Documentation overhaul. Installation instructions are now gathered in
  a single file, INSTALL.md.


CHANGES IN VERSION 0.10
=======================

Upgrading from previous versions:

- Required: Run tools/schema-manager.php to update the database schema.

- Recommended: If you are using the bundled communication server (not the
  original OCS Inventory NG server), remove all PerlModule directives, except
  for Apache::DBI, from the Apache config file to improve server stability.

New features:

- Server/Console: Support for MSofficeKey plugin
  (http://wiki.ocsinventory-ng.org/index.php/Plugins:MSofficeKey)

- Console: Userdefined fields can now be added, renamed or deleted. The database
  representation of field names has been reorganized so that all constraints and
  potential SQL problems are gone.

- Console: Support entering and searching for a Windows product key different
  from the inventoried one. This can be useful if the inventoried key is
  incorrect, which can happen with some license types.

- Console: Licenses overview page. This is intended to become a simple software
  license management system. For now, it only shows a link to manually entered
  Windows product keys.

- Console: The agent whitelist file, which is required by the server to accept
  non-OCS agents like FusionInventory Agent, can now be set in the preferences.
  The file itself must still be maintained manually on the server.

- Console: The preferences dialog complains if only raw zlib compressed
  inventory requests are accepted. Non-zlib requests are required for manual
  inventory upload.

- Tools: New command line tool (decode-ocsfiles.pl) for decoding compressed
  inventory data.

- Server: Load all required Perl modules (except Apache::DBI) automatically, no
  more need to load them in Apache configuration. This makes Apache more robust
  against missing modules. Previously, a missing module would prevent Apache
  startup altogether. Now the impact of missing module is limited to the
  communication server, not affecting other sites hosted by the same Apache
  instance.

- General: Made database name configurable in all components. Some parts had
  previously hardcoded 'ocsweb', which is still used as default if no database
  name is configured. The config templates default to 'braintacle'.

Fixed bugs:

- Console: Always export all software, regardless of blacklist.

- Console: When searching on integer or date fields, the search argument was not
  validated.

Misc:

- General: Documentation overhaul.

- General: Templates for all configuration files are now gathered in a single
  location (config/*.template).

- Server: Rebranding in syslog identification. Syslog messages are now prefixed
  with 'braintacle-server' instead of 'ocsinventory-server'.

- Server: Don't flood Apache log when an option is not explicitly configured and
  a default value is applied instead.

- Console: Improved error reporting.

- Database: The default configuration no longer uses any bad values that the
  preferences dialogs would complain about.

- Database: The GUI_VERSION option, which is used by ocsreports to keep track of
  the database schema version, is no longer touched. Braintacle uses its own
  schema versioning, and once the schema is updated by Braintacle, compatibility
  with original OCS Inventory NG is lost anyway.

- Tools: API documentation is now generated using phpDocumentor 2.

- General: Updated Zend Framework to 1.12.1.

- General: Some internal code restructuring, details can be found in the SVN
  log.
