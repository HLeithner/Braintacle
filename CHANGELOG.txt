CHANGES IN VERSION 0.11
=======================

Upgrading from previous versions:

- Required: Some external libraries (Zend Framework and NADA) are no longer
  included in the distribution. They must be installed manually. See INSTALL.md
  for more information.

New features:

- Console: Groups can now be created from search results. Queries can be set on
  groups, results can be added or excluded.

- Console: Group page shows excluded computers.

- Console: The Network page displays an additional table with all defined device
  types and the number of identified devices per type. A link below that table
  leads to a form that allows adding, renaming and deleting device types. Only
  types that are not assigned to any device can be deleted.

- Console: Subnet properties can be edited.

Fixed bugs:

- Console: Fixed display of package creation dates (0.10 regression)

- Console: Display printers for non-Windows systems too. Note: the UNIX agent
  support for printers is rather limited.

- Console: No longer relies on Apache's AllowEncodedSlashes setting.

Misc:

- Console: Updated the database that determines the vendor from a MAC address.

- General: Documentation overhaul. Installation instructions are now gathered in
  a single file, INSTALL.md.


CHANGES IN VERSION 0.10
=======================

Upgrading from previous versions:

- Required: Run tools/schema-manager.php to update the database schema.

- Recommended: If you are using the bundled communication server (not the
  original OCS Inventory NG server), remove all PerlModule directives, except
  for Apache::DBI, from the Apache config file to improve server stability.

New features:

- Server/Console: Support for MSofficeKey plugin
  (http://wiki.ocsinventory-ng.org/index.php/Plugins:MSofficeKey)

- Console: Userdefined fields can now be added, renamed or deleted. The database
  representation of field names has been reorganized so that all constraints and
  potential SQL problems are gone.

- Console: Support entering and searching for a Windows product key different
  from the inventoried one. This can be useful if the inventoried key is
  incorrect, which can happen with some license types.

- Console: Licenses overview page. This is intended to become a simple software
  license management system. For now, it only shows a link to manually entered
  Windows product keys.

- Console: The agent whitelist file, which is required by the server to accept
  non-OCS agents like FusionInventory Agent, can now be set in the preferences.
  The file itself must still be maintained manually on the server.

- Console: The preferences dialog complains if only raw zlib compressed
  inventory requests are accepted. Non-zlib requests are required for manual
  inventory upload.

- Tools: New command line tool (decode-ocsfiles.pl) for decoding compressed
  inventory data.

- Server: Load all required Perl modules (except Apache::DBI) automatically, no
  more need to load them in Apache configuration. This makes Apache more robust
  against missing modules. Previously, a missing module would prevent Apache
  startup altogether. Now the impact of missing module is limited to the
  communication server, not affecting other sites hosted by the same Apache
  instance.

- General: Made database name configurable in all components. Some parts had
  previously hardcoded 'ocsweb', which is still used as default if no database
  name is configured. The config templates default to 'braintacle'.

Fixed bugs:

- Console: Always export all software, regardless of blacklist.

- Console: When searching on integer or date fields, the search argument was not
  validated.

Misc:

- General: Documentation overhaul.

- General: Templates for all configuration files are now gathered in a single
  location (config/*.template).

- Server: Rebranding in syslog identification. Syslog messages are now prefixed
  with 'braintacle-server' instead of 'ocsinventory-server'.

- Server: Don't flood Apache log when an option is not explicitly configured and
  a default value is applied instead.

- Console: Improved error reporting.

- Database: The default configuration no longer uses any bad values that the
  preferences dialogs would complain about.

- Database: The GUI_VERSION option, which is used by ocsreports to keep track of
  the database schema version, is no longer touched. Braintacle uses its own
  schema versioning, and once the schema is updated by Braintacle, compatibility
  with original OCS Inventory NG is lost anyway.

- Tools: API documentation is now generated using phpDocumentor 2.

- General: Updated Zend Framework to 1.12.1.

- General: Some internal code restructuring, details can be found in the SVN
  log.
